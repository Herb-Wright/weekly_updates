## 1 Last Time

Last time, our meeting was in the middle of the week, so there wasn't too much to talk about. I had some initial registration results that were *okay*, but this week I wanted to try out some things to see if I could do better.

## 2 More Registration Results



## 3 The Bigger Picture



## 4 Progress on Class Project

*No need to read this section, just putting it here to track progress for myself mostly*

## 5 Some Papers to Note

- [@wu2025you] "steers" a VLA by having it generate multiple action sequences, rolling them out in sim, and using a VLM to select the best.
- [@guzman2022bayesian] Uses Bayesian optimization to fit controller hyperparameters and (potentially incorrect) model parameters in order to maximize reward against the true model parameters. This is potentially related to ideas around the usefulness of robust control.
