<h2 data-number="1" id="introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Introduction</h2>
<p>Last time, we talked about trying to move towards a paper. The method
wasn’t quite working last time, but I was pretty sure I could get it
working this week. I didn’t have too much time to write the weekly
write-up because I was mostly focused on writing in the overleaf. Thus,
this week’s write-up is pretty barebones</p>
<h2 data-number="2" id="some-updates"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Some Updates</h2>
<p>So I got the method working earlier in the week, then I tried to
install some code in my env and it messed the env up, which caused CLIP
and other stuff to be weird, so hopefully I can get that fixed over the
weekend. Here is an image of a reconstruction:</p>

<p><strong>Overleaf:</strong> I worked quite a bit on the <a
href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/xdzstgmpkhcf#0edb18">overleaf
doc</a> for the potential paper. I still have some questions about it
that I want guidance on:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>What should Fig. 1 look like? I have some ideas but would like to
get your thoughts.</li>
<li>How is the overall argument up to this point?</li>
<li>Is emphasizing “retrieval-augmented priors” dumb?</li>
<li>How many figures would be too many?</li>
<li>Should the method figure be different?</li>
<li>Negative sampling subsection? Instance segmentation subsection?</li>
<li>…and others questions</li>
</ol>
<p>I also had some ideas that I wanted to try out:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>A figure that shows failure of other methods to poor segmentation,
and our method doing a little better.</li>
<li>Experiment where we take simulation scenes and <em>shift</em> the
segmentation by a couple of pixels</li>
<li>Try out <a href="https://github.com/nv-tlabs/NKSR">NKSR</a> in an
example scene.</li>
<li>MNIST experiment for retrieval-augmented prior</li>
</ol>
<p>Here is my plan for the experiments section this week:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>simulated scenes: show improved accuracy vs V-PRISM and robustness
vs PointSDF</li>
<li>simulated scenes + segmentation shifts: show improved accuracy vs
PointSDF</li>
<li>robustness on real world scenes: qualitative images vs PointSDF and
maybe V-PRISM</li>
<li>uncertainty: show qualitative images of <em>surface</em> uncertainty
vs V-PRISM maybe GPIS?</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Speed of Method:</strong> I got the method running on the GPU
(kind of, I lowkey messed up something in my conda env and CLIP was
malfunctioning). I timed different parts of the method, here are a
couple of those times:</p>
<ul>
<li>RANSAC registration: 3.5 (s)</li>
<li>SVGD reconstruction: 3.2 (s)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Thesis:</strong> I have to turn in a senior thesis by the end
of this semester. So, I trasferred some sections of the V-PRISM paper
over to it and messed with formatting. Here is my current draft:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="thesis.pdf">thesis.pdf</a></li>
